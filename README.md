# Benchmarking-Top-IaaS-providers-using-Real-Time-User-Metrics---------

We assume that we have a client who has requirements of the number of concurrent users to system and s/he wants to use Cassandra. S/he wants to know how many nodes s/he needs, how much performance s/he can get, and how much s/he have to pay. We want to solve this problem through this lab.

The goals/learning points of this lab is
1)	Learn how to launch virtual machine instance on each IaaS providers.
2)	Learn how to install/use NoSQL storage for Big Data, like Cassandra.
3)	Learn how to install YCSB benchmark, compare performance, and analyze it to support business decision.
